# Project: Deploy-Static-Website-on-AWS
The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. The whole project has two major intentions to implement:  
> 1. Hosting a static website on AWS S3 service.
> 2. Accessing the cached website pages using AWS CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service. Recall that CloudFront offers low latency and high transfer speeds during website rendering.
