# Deploy-Static-Website-on-AWS
The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. The whole project has two major intentions to implement:  Hosting a static website on AWS S3 service and Accessing the cached website pages using AWS CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service. Recall that CloudFront offers low latency and high transfer speeds during website rendering.
